      <p class="col-lg-6 text-justify px-0 pt-2 pl-lg-2 py-lg-0">Glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising, cloud forests are dying, and wildlife is scrambling to keep pace. It has become clear that humans have caused most of the past century's
        warming by releasing heat-trapping gases as we power our modern lives. Called greenhouse gases, their levels are higher now than at any time in the last 800,000 years.
        We often call the result global warming, but it is causing a set of changes to the Earth's climate, or long-term weather patterns, that varies from place to place. While many people think of global warming and climate change as synonyms,
        scientists use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems—in part because some areas actually get cooler in the short term.

    <h1 class="row my-4 mx-2 row-with-span shop-name">Plastic Pollution</h1>
    <div class="row mx-2">
      <img class="col-lg-6 p-0 pr-lg-2" src="../img/plasticP.jpg" alt="plastic pollution">
      <p class="col-lg-6 text-justify px-0 pt-2 pl-lg-2 py-lg-0">Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues, as rapidly increasing production of disposable plastic products overwhelms the world’s ability to deal with
        them. Plastic pollution is most visible in developing Asian and African nations, where garbage collection systems are often inefficient or nonexistent. But the developed world, especially in countries with low recycling rates, also has
        trouble properly collecting discarded plastics. Plastic trash has become so ubiquitous it has prompted efforts to write a global treaty negotiated by the United Nations.
        Millions of animals are killed by plastics every year, from birds to fish to other marine beings. Nearly 700 species, including endangered ones, are known to have been affected by plastics. Nearly every species of seabird eats plastics.
        Most of the deaths to animals are caused by entanglement or starvation.

    <h1 class="row my-4 mx-2 row-with-span shop-name">Food Waste</h1>
    <div class="row mx-2">
      <img class="col-lg-6 p-0 pr-lg-2" src="../img/foodW.jpg" alt="food waste">
      <p class="col-lg-6 text-justify px-0 pt-2 pl-lg-2 py-lg-0">800 million people go to bed hungry every night. That is 1 in 9 people on the planet who are starving or malnourished. Each and every one of them could be sufficiently fed on less than
        a quarter of the food that is wasted in the USA, UK and Europe each year.
        Food waste is really, really bad for the environment. It takes a land mass larger than China to grow the food each year that is ultimately never eaten – land that has been deforested, species that have been driven to extinction, indigenous
        populations that have been moved, soil that has been degraded – all to produce food that we then just throw away. In addition, food that is never eaten accounts for 25% of all fresh water consumption globally.
